# Library ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the **Library** repository! This repository is a collection of custom components and libraries for PLECS simulations and Altium Designer, tailored for efficient design and simulation workflows.

## Contents

- **PLECS Simulation Components**
  - Custom blocks and components for use in PLECS simulations.
  - Pre-configured models for common circuit elements and systems.
  - Example simulations to demonstrate component usage.

- **Altium Components and Footprints**
  - A library of custom schematic symbols and PCB footprints.
  - Designed to adhere to standard design practices for ease of integration.
  - Includes 3D models for accurate PCB design visualization.


## Getting Started

### PLECS Simulation Components

1. **Installation**: 
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the `PLECS_Components` directory.
